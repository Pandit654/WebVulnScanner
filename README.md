   - Click on *Protection history*
   - Locate *WebVulnScanner.exe* and click *Restore*

2. **Allow the file through Defender**

   - Open *Windows Security* → *Virus & threat protection*
   - Click *Manage settings* under *Virus & threat protection settings*
   - Scroll to *Exclusions* and click *Add or remove exclusions*
   - Click *Add an exclusion* → *File*, then select `WebVulnScanner.exe`

3. **Run as Administrator**
